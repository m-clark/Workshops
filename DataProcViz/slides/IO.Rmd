## Input/Output

Standard methods of reading in data

  - <span class="func">read.delim</span>
  - <span class="func">read.csv</span>
  - <span class="func">readLines</span>

Using the <span class="pack">foreign</span> package:

  - <span class="func">read.spss</span>
  - <span class="func">read.xport</span>

Note: the foreign package is no longer useful for Stata files.


## Newer approaches

<span class="pack">haven</span>: Package to read in foreign statistical files

  - <span class="func">read_spss</span>
  - <span class="func">read_dta</span>

<span class="pack">readxl</span>: for excel files


## Faster approaches

<span class="pack">readr</span>: Faster versions of base R functions

  - <span class="func">read_csv</span>
  - <span class="func">read_delim</span>

These make assumptions after an initial scan of the data.

If you don't have 'big' data, this won't help much.

However, they actually can be used as a diagnostic

  - pick up potential data entry errors.
