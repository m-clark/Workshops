```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = T, message = F, warning = F, R.options=list(width=120), 
                      fig.width=8, fig.align = 'center', comment=NA, autodep=T)
```

## Excercise #1

Create an object that is a matrix and/or a data.frame, and inspect its class or structure.

```{r}
mydf = data.frame(A=1:3, B=letters[1:3])
```


## Exercise #2

Create a list of 3 elements, the first of which contains character strings, the second numbers, and the third, the data.frame or matrix you just created.

```{r}
mylist = list(c('a', 'b'), 1:3, mydf)
```



## Thinking Exercises

- How is a factor different from a character vector?

- How is a data.frame the same as and different from a matrix?

- How is a data.frame the same as and different from a list?
