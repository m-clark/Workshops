# Exercise 0

Install and load the <span class="pack">data.table</span> package.

Create the following data table.

```
mydt = data.table(expand.grid(x=1:3, y=c('a','b','c')), z=sample(1:20, 9))
```

# Exercise 1

Create a new object that contains only the 'a' group. Think back to how you use a logical to select rows.

```{r}
mydt_a = mydt[y=='a',]
```


# Exercise 2

Create a new object that is the sum of z grouped by x. You don't need to name the sum variable.


```{r}
mydt_grpsum = mydt[,sum(z), by=x]
mydt_grpsum = mydt[,list(sumz=sum(z)), by=x]
```
