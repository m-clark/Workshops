Note that in each exercise, the code is hidden by default, allowing you to test your skills first.  Disclose the code if you get stuck, but try on your own/work together first. Make sure you load the packages you need for the exercise.

## A NOTE ABOUT INSTALLING R PACKAGES ON THE LAB MACHINES

You do not have write access to the default R library folder. When you attempt to install the first package, a <span class="emph">**pop-under**</span> window will come up (look at your task bar), and ask you if you want to try someplace else.  Just click yes, as it will have selected an appropriate location.


In each exercise the following color scheme is used:

- <span class="pack">package</span>
- <span class="func">function</span>
- <span class="objclass">object</span> (or object class)
- <span class="emph">emphasis</span>
