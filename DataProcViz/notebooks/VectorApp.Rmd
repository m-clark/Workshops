## Exercise #1

Note the following x object and loop regarding it.

```
n = 1000
x = rnorm(n)
for(i in 1:n){
  x[i] = 2*x[i]/10
}
```

Create the same x object, and demonstrate a vectorized approach to doing the same operation that the above attempts.

```{r eval=FALSE}
n = 1000
x = rnorm(n)
x = 2*x[i]/10
```


## Exercise #2

Create the following matrix and show two ways to get the sum of the rows or columns.  One way should use the apply function, neither should use an explicit loop.

```
x = matrix(sample(1:100), ncol=10)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
rowSums(x)
apply(x, 2, sum)
```
