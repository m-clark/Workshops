This following is a refresher of base R indexing only.

Here is a matrix, a data.frame and a list.

```
mymatrix = matrix(rnorm(100), 10, 10)
mydf = cars
mylist = list(mymatrix, thisdf = mydf)
```


## Exercise 1

For the matrix, in separate operations, take a slice of rows, a selection of columns, and a single element.

```{r}
mymatrix[1:5, ]
mymatrix[, 1:5]
mymatrix[1,2]
```


## Exercise 2

For the data.frame, grab a column in 3 different ways.

```{r}
mydf$dist
mydf[,2]
mydf['dist']
```


## Exercise 3

For the list grab an element by number and by name.

```{r}
mylist[2]
mylist$thisdf
```
