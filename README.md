# Workshops

This repository is more or less a list of other repos and the associated slides and docs that are specific to workshops or talks I've given. The repos house notes/slides/code/data etc. They are roughly in chronological order based on when they were given last, and I link to the presentation as given and repo.

**Become a Bayesian in 10 Minutes**: Talk aimed at giving an introduction Bayesian modeling in R via the Stan programming language.
