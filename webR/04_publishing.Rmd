# Publishing

The publishing capabilities in R are phenomenal, and keep expanding all the time.  From standard type documents (including pdf and word) to building whole websites with loads of interactivity, R can generally take you where you want to go.

## Markdown


## HTML, CSS etc.


## Documents

### Journals

## Presentations

For better or worse, at present there are multiple types of presentations one might use in R.  

- <span class="emph">ioslides</span>:	HTML presentation with ioslides
- <span class="emph">reveal.js</span>:	HTML presentation with reveal.js
- <span class="emph">Slidy</span>:	HTML presentation with W3C Slidy
- <span class="emph">Beamer</span>:	PDF presentation with LaTeX Beamer

These days I cannot think of a reason to do a set of pdf slides as there is no real benefit to doing so. The others are more configurable and can work on any device as easily.
