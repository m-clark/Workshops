# Visualization

R has come a long way very quickly with regard to interactive and web-based visualization.

## htmlwidgets

Many newer visualization packages take advantage of piping.

<span class='pack'>htmlwidgets</span> is a package that makes it easy to create javascript visualizations.

- i.e. what you see everywhere on the web.

The packages using it typically are pipe-oriented and produce interactive plots.

```{r}
Rlogo = file.path(R.home('doc'), 'html', 'logo.jpg')
points = cbind(lon=c(-83.738233,-83.7582789), lat=c(42.280799, 42.2668577))
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  setView(mean(points[,1]), mean(points[,2]), zoom = 14) %>% 
  addMarkers(points[,1], points[,2], 
             icon=list(iconUrl=c('../img/Rlogo.png', 'img/UM.png'),
                       iconSize = c(75, 75)),
             popup = c('CSCAR', 'Big House'))
```
